This code defines a Key class, and two functions make_key() and count_words(). 
The Key class has attributes first, last, and freq, and two methods, __eq__() and __hash__(). 
The make_key() function takes a word as input and returns a Key object for that word. The count_words() 
function takes a list of words (dictionary) and a text as input, and returns the number of words in the 
dictionary that can be formed using any length consecutive characters in the text, where length is the 
length of a word in the dictionary.

The Key class is used to store information about each word in the dictionary, such as the first and last 
character, and the frequency of each letter in the word. The make_key() function creates a Key object 
for a given word by iterating over each character in the word and updating the frequency count in the 
freq attribute of the Key object. The count_words() function iterates over each word in the dictionary,
 creates a Key object for the word using the make_key() function, and stores the Key object in a 
 dictionary called groups along with a count of how many times that Key object appears in the dictionary.

The count_words() function then iterates over each unique word length in the dictionary, and for 
each length, it creates a new Key object with empty first and last characters and a frequency list, 
and iterates over the text to find all length consecutive characters. For each consecutive set of 
length characters, it updates the first and last attributes of the Key object, as well as the 
frequency count of each letter in the freq attribute. It then checks if the Key object exists in 
the groups dictionary, and if so, increments the answer variable by the count of that Key object 
and removes the Key object from the groups dictionary. Finally, it returns the answer variable, 
which represents the total number of words in the dictionary that can be formed using consecutive 
characters in the text.



The space complexity of this code is O(N * M), where N is the length of the input text 
and M is the number of words in the dictionary. This is because the code uses a hash table 
(implemented as a Python dictionary) to store groups of words that share the same first and 
last characters, as well as the same frequency distribution of characters. The size of this 
hash table can be as large as the number of distinct groups of words in the dictionary, which is at most M.

The time complexity of this code is O(N * M * L), where N is the length of the input text,
 M is the number of words in the dictionary, and L is the maximum length of a word in the 
 dictionary. The outer loop iterates over the possible word lengths in the text, which can 
 be at most N. For each word length, the code builds a Key object and checks whether it is 
 in the hash table, which takes O(1) expected time on average. If the key is found, the 
 corresponding count is added to the answer and the key is deleted from the hash table. 
 Otherwise, the code simply moves the key window one character to the right and updates 
 the Key object accordingly, which takes O(L) time. Since the maximum length of a word in 
 the dictionary is a constant, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(N * M).
